    <h2>ACT25 & CAS</h2>
    <p>I am CAS, the primary owner of ACT25, and I want to use this website to share my creations with the world. I enjoy coding and I'm quite a nerd. The website you are on (www.act25.com) is coded completely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. The site is hosted for free using GitHub Pages. You can check out the repo <a href="https://github.com/dynamite14/dynamite14.github.io">here</a>. I was originally going to keep the site as barebones as possible, using only <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Times New Roman</span> font and minimal styling. But I eventually decided to continue improving the website. Every piece of code here is one that I understand and put here myself — no installed themes or website builders were used. I am enjoying making the website this way.</p>
